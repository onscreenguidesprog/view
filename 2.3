When you want to add high-level information (project metadata) that provides extra details about your projects, you can add any number of columns of custom fields in the project portfolio list view.
**NOTE: Only admins can create new fields and/or edit existing ones.
However, a customized field can be created with certain restrictions. For example, the admin can select to give access to a  project manager role to update a specific field.
